    <description>
      ripgrep is a command line search tool that combines the usability of The Silver Searcher (an ack clone)
      with the raw speed of GNU grep. ripgrep has first class support on Windows, Mac and Linux, with binary
      downloads available for every release.

      ## Notes

      We are currently depending on Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 https://chocolatey.org/packages/vcredist2015. This will change once this https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37545 is resolved and ripgrep can statically link the CRT.

    <releaseNotes>
ripgrep 11.0.2 is a new patch release that fixes a few bugs, including a
performance regression and a matching bug when using the `-F/--fixed-strings`
flag.

In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search
tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By
default, ripgrep will respect your `.gitignore` and automatically skip hidden
files/directories and binary files.

Feature enhancements:

* [FEATURE #1293](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1293):
  Added `--glob-case-insensitive` flag that makes `--glob` behave as `--iglob`.

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #1246](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1246):
  Add translations to README, starting with an unofficial Chinese translation.
* [BUG #1259](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1259):
  Fix bug where the last byte of a `-f file` was stripped if it wasn't a `\
`.
* [BUG #1261](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1261):
  Document that no error is reported when searching for `\
` with `-P/--pcre2`.
* [BUG #1284](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1284):
  Mention `.ignore` and `.rgignore` more prominently in the README.
* [BUG #1292](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1292):
  Fix bug where `--with-filename` was sometimes enabled incorrectly.
* [BUG #1268](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1268):
  Fix major performance regression in GitHub `x86_64-linux` binary release.
* [BUG #1302](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1302):
  Show better error messages when a non-existent preprocessor command is given.
* [BUG #1334](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1334):
  Fix match regression with `-F` flag when patterns contain meta characters.

    <description>
      ripgrep is a command line search tool that combines the usability of The Silver Searcher (an ack clone)
      with the raw speed of GNU grep. ripgrep has first class support on Windows, Mac and Linux, with binary
      downloads available for every release.

      ## Notes

      We are currently depending on Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 https://chocolatey.org/packages/vcredist2015. This will change once this https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37545 is resolved and ripgrep can statically link the CRT.

    <releaseNotes>
ripgrep 11.0.1 is a new patch release that fixes a search regression introduced
in the previous 11.0.0 release. In particular, ripgrep can enter an infinite
loop for some search patterns when searching invalid UTF-8.

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #1247](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1247):
  Fix search bug that can cause ripgrep to enter an infinite loop.

Notes for 11.0.0

ripgrep 11 is a new major version release of ripgrep that contains many bug
fixes, some performance improvements and a few feature enhancements. Notably,
ripgrep's user experience for binary file filtering has been improved. See the
[guide's new section on binary data](GUIDE.md#binary-data) for more details.

In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search
tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By
default, ripgrep will respect your `.gitignore` and automatically skip hidden
files/directories and binary files.

This release also marks a change in ripgrep's versioning. Where as the previous
version was `0.10.0`, this version is `11.0.0`. Moving forward, ripgrep's
major version will be increased a few times per year. ripgrep will continue to
be conservative with respect to backwards compatibility, but may occasionally
introduce breaking changes, which will always be documented in this CHANGELOG.
See [issue 1172](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1172) for a bit
more detail on why this versioning change was made.

This release increases the **minimum supported Rust version** from 1.28.0 to
1.34.0.

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

* ripgrep has tweaked its exit status codes to be more like GNU grep's. Namely,
  if a non-fatal error occurs during a search, then ripgrep will now always
  emit a `2` exit status code, regardless of whether a match is found or not.
  Previously, ripgrep would only emit a `2` exit status code for a catastrophic
  error (e.g., regex syntax error). One exception to this is if ripgrep is run
  with `-q/--quiet`. In that case, if an error occurs and a match is found,
  then ripgrep will exit with a `0` exit status code.
* Supplying the `-u/--unrestricted` flag three times is now equivalent to
  supplying `--no-ignore --hidden --binary`. Previously, `-uuu` was equivalent
  to `--no-ignore --hidden --text`. The difference is that `--binary` disables
  binary file filtering without potentially dumping binary data into your
  terminal. That is, `rg -uuu foo` should now be equivalent to `grep -r foo`.
* The `avx-accel` feature of ripgrep has been removed since it is no longer
  necessary. All uses of AVX in ripgrep are now enabled automatically via
  runtime CPU feature detection. The `simd-accel` feature does remain available
  (only for enabling SIMD for transcoding), however, it does increase
  compilation times substantially at the moment.

Performance improvements:

* [PERF #497](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/497),
  [PERF #838](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/838):
  Make `rg -F -f dictionary-of-literals` much faster.

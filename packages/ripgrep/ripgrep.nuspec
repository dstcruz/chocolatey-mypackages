    <description>
      ripgrep is a command line search tool that combines the usability of The Silver Searcher (an ack clone)
      with the raw speed of GNU grep. ripgrep has first class support on Windows, Mac and Linux, with binary
      downloads available for every release.

      ## Notes

      We are currently depending on Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 https://chocolatey.org/packages/vcredist2015. This will change once this https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37545 is resolved and ripgrep can statically link the CRT.

    <releaseNotes>
This is a new minor version release of ripgrep that contains some minor new
features and a panoply of bug fixes.

Releases provided on Github for `x86_64` will now work on all target CPUs, and
will also automatically take advantage of features found on modern CPUs (such
as AVX2) for additional optimizations.

This release increases the **minimum supported Rust version** from 1.20.0 to
1.23.0.

It is anticipated that the next release of ripgrep (0.10.0) will provide
multi-line search support and a JSON output format.

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

* When `--count` and `--only-matching` are provided simultaneously, the
  behavior of ripgrep is as if the `--count-matches` flag was given. That is,
  the total number of matches is reported, where there may be multiple matches
  per line. Previously, the behavior of ripgrep was to report the total number
  of matching lines. (Note that this behavior diverges from the behavior of
  GNU grep.)
* Octal syntax is no longer supported. ripgrep previously accepted expressions
  like `\\1` as syntax for matching `U+0001`, but ripgrep will now report an
  error instead.
* The `--line-number-width` flag has been removed. Its functionality was not
  carefully considered with all ripgrep output formats.
  See [#795](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/795) for more
  details.

Feature enhancements:

* Added or improved file type filtering for Android, Bazel, Fuschia, Haskell,
  Java and Puppet.
* [FEATURE #411](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/411):
  Add a `--stats` flag, which emits aggregate statistics after search results.
* [FEATURE #646](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/646):
  Add a `--no-ignore-messages` flag, which suppresses parse errors from reading
  `.ignore` and `.gitignore` files.
* [FEATURE #702](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/702):
  Support `\\u{..}` Unicode escape sequences.
* [FEATURE #812](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/812):
  Add `-b/--byte-offset` flag that shows the byte offset of each matching line.
* [FEATURE #814](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/814):
  Add `--count-matches` flag, which is like `--count`, but for each match.
* [FEATURE #880](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/880):
  Add a `--no-column` flag, which disables column numbers in the output.
* [FEATURE #898](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/898):
  Add support for `lz4` when using the `-z/--search-zip` flag.
* [FEATURE #924](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/924):
  `termcolor` has moved to its own repository:
  https://github.com/BurntSushi/termcolor
* [FEATURE #934](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/934):
  Add a new flag, `--no-ignore-global`, that permits disabling global
  gitignores.
* [FEATURE #967](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/967):
  Rename `--maxdepth` to `--max-depth` for consistency. Keep `--maxdepth` for
  backwards compatibility.
* [FEATURE #978](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/978):
  Add a `--pre` option to filter inputs with an arbitrary program.
* [FEATURE fca9709d](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/fca9709d):
  Improve zsh completion.
